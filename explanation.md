## Resources

### MySQL

Use the provided DB Migration files to create the tables in the MySQL database. Feel free to create new tables or modify the ones provided, but make sure include the new migrations in the repository.


## Sections

The functionalities you must implement in this project can be divided into the following sections:

 1.⁠ ⁠Landing Page
 2.⁠ ⁠Sign Up
 3.⁠ ⁠Sign In
 4.⁠ ⁠Homepage (Feed)
 5.⁠ ⁠Post Management
 6.⁠ ⁠User Profile
 7.⁠ ⁠Interactions (Likes & Comments)

### Landing Page

| Endpoints | Method |
|-----------| ------ |
| /         | GET    |

The Landing Page will display a welcome message along with a button to invite users to either Sign In or Register. It must show the amazing features of the application. The page should be visually appealing and responsive, ensuring a great user experience across all devices.

This page is only accessible to unregistered users, meaning that logged users should be redirected to ⁠ /home ⁠.

### Sign-up

This section describes the process of signing up a new user into the system.

| Endpoints  | Method |
| ---------- | ------ |
| /sign-up   | GET    |
| /sign-up   | POST   |

When a user accesses the ⁠ /sign-up ⁠ endpoint, you need to display the registration form. The information from the form must be sent to the same endpoint using a *POST* method. The registration form should include the following inputs:

•⁠  ⁠Username - optional. If users do not provide a username, the system will use the email address as the username (without the domain).
•⁠  ⁠Profile picture - optional. If users do not provide a profile picture, the system will use a default image.
•⁠  ⁠Email - required.
•⁠  ⁠Password - required.
•⁠  ⁠Repeat password - required.

When a *POST* request is sent to the ⁠ /sign-up ⁠ endpoint, you must validate the information received from the form and sign up the user only if all the validations have passed. The requirements for each field are as follows:

•⁠  ⁠Email: It must be a valid email address (@students.salle.url.edu, @ext.salle.url.edu or @salle.url.edu). The email must be unique among all users of the application.
•⁠  ⁠Password: It must not be empty and must contain at least 8 characters, at least one number and both upper and lower case letters.
•⁠  ⁠Repeat password: It must be the same as the password field.

If there are any errors, you need to display the sign-up form again. All the information entered by the user should be kept and shown in the form (except for password fields) together with all the errors below the corresponding inputs.

Here are the error messages that you need to show respectively:

•⁠  ⁠Only emails from the domain @students.salle.url.edu, @ext.salle.url.edu or @salle.url.edu are accepted.
•⁠  ⁠The email address is not valid.
•⁠  ⁠The email address is already registered.
•⁠  ⁠The password must contain at least 8 characters.
•⁠  ⁠The password must contain both upper and lower case letters and numbers.
•⁠  ⁠Passwords do not match.

Once the user's account is created, the system will allow the user to sign in with the newly created credentials.

### Sign-in

This section describes the process of logging into the system.

| Endpoints  | Method |
| ---------- | ------ |
| /sign-in   | GET    |
| /sign-in   | POST   |

When a user accesses the ⁠ /sign-in ⁠ endpoint, you need to display the sign-in form. The information from the form must be sent to the same endpoint using a *POST* method. The sign-in form should include the following inputs:

•⁠  ⁠Email - required.
•⁠  ⁠Password - required.

When the application receives a *POST* request to the ⁠ /sign-in ⁠ endpoint, it must validate the information received from the form and attempt to log in the user. The validations for the inputs should be the same as in the registration.

If there are any errors or if the user does not exist, you need to display the form again with all the information provided by the user and display the corresponding error.

Here are the error messages that you need to show respectively:

•⁠  ⁠The email address is not valid.
•⁠  ⁠Your email and/or password are incorrect.

After logging in, the user will be redirected to the homepage.

### Homepage

| Endpoints | Method |
|-----------| ------ |
| /home     | GET    |

This page represents the main feed of the application and must display all posts created by users.

Only authenticated users can access this page. If the user is not logged in, they must be redirected to ⁠ /sign-in ⁠ with an appropriate message.

The page must display a list of posts ordered by most recent first. Each post must include:

•⁠  ⁠Author (username and profile picture)
•⁠  ⁠Post content (text and optional image)
•⁠  ⁠Creation date

| /posts/{id}/comments   | POST   |
| /comments/{id}         | DELETE |

### Considerations

	⁠*IMPORTANT:* The AI functionality must be implemented through your own backend. The frontend must not call the external AI API directly. Instead, it must send requests to your own endpoint (e.g., ⁠ /ai/improve ⁠), which will internally communicate with the external AI service using Guzzle.

	⁠*IMPORTANT:* The homepage can be initially rendered using server-side rendering (PHP). However, you are encouraged to use JavaScript (AJAX, fetch, etc.) to interact with your API (e.g., loading posts, likes, comments) to create a more dynamic user experience without full page reloads.

There are also additional considerations to take into account:

 1.⁠ ⁠The endpoints described in the previous sections MUST be used exactly as specified. You cannot use alternative routes such as ⁠ /login ⁠ or ⁠ /register ⁠.

 2.⁠ ⁠You must implement your own API for posts, likes, comments, and AI interactions, and consume it from your frontend.

 3.⁠ ⁠The application must clearly separate frontend (views) and backend (API logic).

 4.⁠ ⁠You can use templates or UI frameworks to build the interface, but all backend logic must be implemented by you.

 5.⁠ ⁠Only authenticated users can access protected routes such as ⁠ /home ⁠, ⁠ /profile ⁠, or any post-related functionality.

 6.⁠ ⁠Users must only be able to modify or delete their own content (posts and comments).

 7.⁠ ⁠The AI feature must be integrated using an external API and should improve the user’s post content before submission.

 8.⁠ ⁠Clean code, proper structure, and readability will be taken into account during evaluation.

## Submission

You must submit this exercise in two different ways:

•⁠  ⁠*Git:* You will use Git and annotated tags to release new versions of your application. Tags should be pushed to the Gitlab repository to make them accessible to your team and instructors. Use *tag* ⁠ v1.0.0 ⁠ for the final version.

•⁠  ⁠*eStudy:* For academic reasons, you must also upload a zipped copy of the final repository version on eStudy using the following filename format:
  ⁠ lsminisocial_<your_login>.zip ⁠

•⁠  ⁠Only one member of the team must upload the project to eStudy.

Make sure that everything needed to properly run your application is included in the repository (including DB Migration files). Avoid committing unnecessary files (such as the contents of the ⁠ vendor ⁠ folder or user uploads), as they will remain in the repository history and increase its size.

You can only submit this project in the ordinary call. The deadline will be announced on eStudy.

	⁠*IMPORTANT:* You must include an ⁠ INSTRUCTIONS.md ⁠ file with all the necessary information to run and use your application. This is especially important for features such as the AI integration or any additional functionality, as we need to understand your implementation decisions.

## Evaluation

 1.⁠ ⁠Once the project is delivered, you will be interviewed by the teachers.
 2.⁠ ⁠In this interview, we will validate that you understand the code you have written and the concepts behind it.
 3.⁠ ⁠Check the syllabus of the subject for further information.
 4.⁠ ⁠Only github repositories will be evaluated. The project should be also uploaded to eStudy but only for the university's records.
 5.⁠ ⁠The eStudy upload must be done using the filename format: ⁠ lsminisocial_<your_login>.zip ⁠.
 6.⁠ ⁠In order to be evaluated, your project must be tagged with ⁠ v1.0.0 ⁠ in github.
